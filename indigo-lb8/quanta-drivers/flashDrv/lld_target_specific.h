/* NOTICE
MirrorBit flash devices requires 4us from the time    
a programming command is issued before the data polling 
bits can be read.  Without the delay, it is likely
that you will read invalid status from the flash.
The invalid status may lead the software to believe
that programming finished early without problems or 
that programming failed.  If your system has more 
than 4us of delay inherently, you don't need any 
additional delay.  Otherwise, change the #undef to 
a #define
WAIT_4us_FOR_DATA_POLLING_BITS_TO_BECOME_ACTIVE
in lld.h.  Make sure your optimization does not          
remove the delay loop.  You must replace DELAY_4us    
with a value which makes sense for your system.       

It is possible to suspend the erase operation 
with such frequency that it is unable to complete 
the erase operation and eventually times-out.                                            
Change the #undef to #define PAUSE_BETWEEN_ERASE_SUSPENDS 
in lld.h if you are using erase suspend and the 
following is true.
Time between suspends is less that 10 milliseconds    
AND total number of suspends per erase can exceed 5000.         
Make sure that your optimization does not remove the  
delay loop.  You must replace DELAY_10ms with a value 
which make sense in your system.

If you are using MirrorBit devices, change the macro
#undef MIRRORBIT_DEVICE to #define MIRRORBIT_DEVICE.
